A new Flutter plugin that uses OpenVpn.

# Installation

1. Depend on it
   Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

```dart
dependencies:
  flutter_openvpn: ^0.2.0

```

2. Install it
   You can install packages from the command line:

with Flutter:

```dart
$ flutter pub get
```

Alternatively, your editor might support flutter pub get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

3. Import it
   Now in your Dart code, you can use:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_openvpn/flutter_openvpn.dart';
```

### Supported Platforms

- `22` >= Android
- `9.0` >= iOS

### Build project first

- After adding package to pubspec.yaml, Run build command

```dart
flutter build apk --debug //for android
flutter build ios --no-codesign //for ios
```

Ignore any build errors.

### Android integration

- Change minimum sdk to 22 :

1. Open Your project in Android Studio.
2. Open your MainActivity.java(or .kt for kotlin) file
   (Located in android/app/src/main/YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME/MainActivity)
3. Override onActivityResult in your activity and add this code to function body

```dart
if (requestCode == 1) {
    if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
        FlutterOpenvpnPlugin.setPermission(true);
    } else {
        FlutterOpenvpnPlugin.setPermission(false);
    }
}
```

4. Finally import FlutterOpenVpn with this import statement

```dart
import com.topfreelancerdeveloper.flutter_openvpn.FlutterOpenvpnPlugin;
```

          localizedDescription: "ExampleVPN", //this is required only on iOS
          providerBundleIdentifier: "com.topfreelancerdeveloper.flutterOpenvpnExample.RunnerExtension",//this is required only on iOS
	  //localizedDescription is the name of your VPN profile
	  //providerBundleIdentifier is the bundle id of your vpn extension
)
/* returns {"currentStatus" : "VPN_CURRENT_STATUS",
	   "expireAt" : "VPN_EXPIRE_DATE_STRING_IN_FORMAT(yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss)",} if successful
 returns null if failed
*/
```

View [this](https://gitlab.com/topfreelancerdeveloper/flutter_openvpn/-/blob/master/ios/Classes/VPNUtils.swift) for more info on VPN status Strings

FlutterOpenvpn.lunchVpn(
          ovpnFileContent, //content of your .ovpn file
          (isProfileLoaded) => print('isProfileLoaded : $isProfileLoaded'),
          (newVpnStatus) => print('vpnActivated : $newVpnStatus'),
          expireAt: DateTime.now().add(Duration(seconds: 30)),
	  //(Optional) VPN automatically disconnects in next 30 seconds
         )
